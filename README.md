# A-simplified-COVID-19-Model
A simplified COVID-19 Model made using MATLAB
 The so-called SEIR model is a standard way to model the
spread of infectious diseases. It is an example of a compartmental model. We will look at this
model in its most basic form, and solve it numerically for various parameters.
The population of N individuals is assigned to different compartments, and individuals can move
between compartments. The SEIR model uses four compartments, S,E, I,R, representing segments
of the population, so S+E+I+R = N (a simplification, meaning the total population is constant,
with some leeway in interpreting the term "total population").
S. Susceptible individuals. Those are healthy, and not immune individuals who may become
infected upon contact with an infected individual.
E. Exposed individuals. These are individuals who have been infected, but because of the
incubation period of the virus are not yet infectious themselves. They will transition to the
infected group;
I. Infected individuals. These are individuals who have been infected, and can pass on the
infection to susceptible individuals.
R. Removed individuals. (In an optimistic scenario referred to as recovered individuals.) These
include people who have recovered and are now immune, and people who have died.
